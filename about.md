<p class="message">
I'm an eclectic person in the tech world which makes me quite addicted to experiencing any recent content. I'm experienced in Delphi, C/C++, Objective-C and Java. Right now I'm active on iOS Development, Freeletics (a sport), eating clean (cooking), hand made vine and restoring old stuff.
